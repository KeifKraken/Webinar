Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main temple.
Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows.
Leia is dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.
She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck.
He winks at her.
She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who is moved by the event.
They turn and face the assembled troops, who all bow before them.
Lastly, the Princess places a HUGE medallion, like the biggest you've ever seen, around Chewbacca's neck an he's just so happy.
Artoo beeps with happiness.
